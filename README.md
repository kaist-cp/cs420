## Course description

### Context

**Compilers bridge the gap between human and machine.** Human wants to easily express complex
idea. On the other hand, machine understands only a few words (instructions) to be efficiently
implemented in silicon. Compilers transform programs from a form suitable for human to easily
express complex idea, to a form suitable for machine to efficiently execute. Since the gap between
human and machine is fundamentally wide, compilers have been constructed and widely used since the
beginning of the history of computing. Even, the first practical compiler predates the first
practical operating systems (according to Wikipedia)!

**In response to industry shifts, new compilers should be written and written again.** First, human
wants to express more and more complex idea, especially in the era of artificial intelligence and
big data. Second, machine changes in response to physics (e.g. the ending of Dennard scaling and
Moore's law) and industrial needs (e.g. Internet of Things and distributed systems). New compilers
should be constructed to close the new gap between changing human and changing machine. For this
reason, industrial needs for (and salary of) compiler engineers have been constantly high.


### Goal

**In this class, we will learn how to construct a compiler by actually building one.** You are going
to benefit from the provided skeleton code of a clean slate educational compiler--dubbed *KECC:
KAIST Educational C Compiler* (think: [KENS](https://an.kaist.ac.kr/kensv3-doc/) for networking or
[Pintos](https://pintos-os.org/), [xv6](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2019/xv6.html) for
operating systems). We are going to discuss parsing only briefly, because the topic is assumed to be
dealt with in CS322: Formal Languages and Automata. (You don't need to know parsing to take this
course, though.) We will focus on translation from human-friendly form to machine-friendly form, and
compiler optimizations. Specifically, we will discuss (1) how to transform a C program to an
[SSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form)-based [intermediate
representation (IR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation); (2) how to perform
register promotion, static single assignment, global value numbering, and register allocation
optimizations on the IR; and (3) how to transform an IR program to a
[RISC-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V) assembly program. KECC will provide a significant
amount of skeleton code so that you can focus on the topic of this course.

**We will also briefly discuss the recent trends of compiler construction.** I see two crucial
recent trends: script languages and parallelism. (1) Scripting languages like JavaScript and Python,
unlike C, should be compiled (or interpreted) at run-time, and therefore, there is no clear
distinction of compile- and run-time. It is a challenge in that compile time should also be
optimized, but it is also an opportunity in that compile may gather and benefit from run-time
information. (2) It is crucial to exploit the massive parallelism of modern applications like deep
learning and high-performance computing (HPC), because they require so huge computation. Due to the
complexity of workloads, their parallelism should be automatically discovered and exploited by
compilers, which is a big challenge.

**We will also briefly study the theory of compiler.** We will focus on the correctness of
compiler. In general, in what sense a compiler is correct, and how to prove it?  Specifically, how
to prove the correctness of KECC's transformations and optimizations? As it will turn out, this
compiler correctness theory will greatly help you efficiently build your own compiler.

### Tools

Make sure you're capable of using the following development tools:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): for downloading KECC and version-controlling your development. If
  you're not familiar with Git, walk through [this
  tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials).

  NOTE: When you do your homework with KECC, you should be careful not to expose your work to others. 
  Please follow steps below:
  
  - To duplicate `KECC` without forking it, you can run a clone command.
  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/kaist-cp/kecc-public.git
  $ cd kecc-public.git/
  $ git remote -v
  origin	https://github.com/kaist-cp/kecc-public.git (fetch)
  origin	https://github.com/kaist-cp/kecc-public.git (push)
  ```
  - To get updates from the original, you can fetch and merge origin master to your working branch.
  ```bash
  $ git fetch origin
  $ git merge origin/master
  ```

  or

  - Please create new private repository to clone `KECC`. 
    (you may update your github account to `PRO`. Please refer to the [link](https://education.github.com/students))
  - Clone your private repository into your local working space.
  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/<your-github-id>/<private-repo>.git # may need password
  $ cd <private-repo>.git/
  $ git remote -v
  origin	https://github.com/<your-github-id>/<private-repo>.git (fetch)
  origin	https://github.com/<your-github-id>/<private-repo>.git (push)
  ```
  - If you want to get updates from the original, you need to set upstream as original repository.
  ```bash
  $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/kaist-cp/kecc-public.git
  $ git remote -v
  origin	 https://github.com/<your-github-id>/<private-repo>.git (fetch)
  origin	 https://github.com/<your-github-id>/<private-repo>.git (push)
  upstream https://github.com/kaist-cp/kecc-public.git (fetch)
  upstream https://github.com/kaist-cp/kecc-public.git (push)
  ```
  - To get updates from the original, you can fetch and merge upstream master to your working branch.
  ```bash
  $ git fetch upstream
  $ git merge upstream/master
  ```

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): as the language of homework implementation. We chose Rust
  because its ownership type system greatly simplifies the development of large-scale system
  software. If you want to "opt out", you can also use FFI and implement your compiler in C/C++.

  We recommend you to read [this page](https://github.com/kaist-cp/helpdesk/#specialty) that
  describes how to study Rust.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (optional): for developing your homework. If
  you prefer other editors, you're good to go.
    - [NOTE: If permission denied error occurs when trying to install `CodeLLDB Extension` into the 
      remote server](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs420/issues/5), please follow the steps: 
      (1) Download [this file](https://github.com/vadimcn/vscode-lldb/releases/download/v1.5.0/codelldb-x86_64-linux.vsix) at the remote server, 
      (2) Follow [the instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_install-from-a-vsix) to install it.
      
- If you want, you'll be provided with a Linux server account. [Please submit your SSH key
  here](https://gg.kaist.ac.kr/assignment/6/). You can connect to server by `ssh
  s<student-id>@cp-service.kaist.ac.kr -p10005`, e.g., `ssh s20071163@cp-service.kaist.ac.kr
  -p10005`.

    + Your private key `id_ed25519` should be in `~/.ssh`.

    + Add the following lines in your `~/.ssh/config`:
    
      ```
      Host cs420
        Hostname cp-service.kaist.ac.kr
        Port 10005
        User s<student-id>
      ```
      
      Then you can connect to the server by `ssh cs420`.

    + Now you can [use it as a VSCode remote server as in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTVuUIhdn_g&list=PL5aMzERQ_OZ8RWqn-XiZLXm1IJuaQbXp0&index=3).


## Prerequisites

- It is **strongly recommended** that students already took courses on:

    + Mathematics (calculus MAS101 & MAS102 or discrete mathematics CS204): proposition
      statement and proof
    + Data structures (CS206): linked list, stack, queue
    + Systems programming (CS230): memory layout
    + Programming languages (CS320): lambda calculus, interpreter

  Without a proper understanding of these topics, you will likely struggle in this course.

- Other recommendations which would help you in this course:

    + Basic understanding of computer architecture (CS311)
    + Programming experience in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)


## Grading & honor code

### Homework (80%)

You will implement translations and optimizations on KECC. All homework submissions will be
automatically graded online so that you can immediately see your score. If your compiler is correct
and the generated assemblies perform comparably to those generated by `gcc -O1`, you're going to get
A+ (if not A\#) even if you miss the midterm exam.

Since compiler construction requires nontrivial undertaking, you're encouraged to ask questions on
the homework in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs420/issues) at the early stage of
the semester.

### Midterm exam (20%)

The exam will evaluate your understanding of compiler theory.  There will not be a final exam.

### Attendance (?%)

You should submit a token to the [Course Management](https://gg.kaist.ac.kr/course/3/) website for
each session.  You should submit a token within **12 hours from the beginning of a session**.

### Honor code

[Please sign KAIST School of Computing Honor Code here](https://gg.kaist.ac.kr/quiz/1/).



## Communication

- Course-related announcements and information will be posted on the
  [website](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs420) as well as on the [GitHub issue
  tracker](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs420/issues).  You are expected to read all
  announcements within 24 hours of their being posted.  It is highly recommended to watch the
  repository so that new announcements will automatically be delivered to you email address.

- Ask your questions via email **only if** they are either confidential or personal.  Otherwise, ask
   questions in [this repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs420/issues).  Any
   questions failing to do so (e.g. email questions on course materials) will not be answered.

    + I'm requiring you to ask questions online first for two reasons. First, clearly writing a
      question is the first step to reach an answer. Second, you can benefit from questions and
      answers of other students.

- Emails to the instructor or TAs should begin with "CS420:" in the subject line, followed by a
  brief description of the purpose of your email.  The content should at least contain your name and
  student number.  Any emails failing to do so (e.g. emails without student number) will not be
  answered.
